Here we go!

This is a piece (the first) that I did on the workspace's whiteboard.

Since the department's name change to Metadata Syndication (METS), folks were talking about a logo but none was being provided.

So there was this day (2023-12-20) that I randomly decided to get up, go to the whiteboard and draw something.
And that's what I got at the end, my first graffiti style art. 

Eventually it got removed when we moved the department's members to another floor.

Thanks, camarada [@lino339](https://www.twitch.tv/lino339) for showing me the art of graffiti.
